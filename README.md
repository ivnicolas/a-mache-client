# Color Your Feeling Project(Front-end)

This application takes  inspiration from Craigslist to provide Haitian people with a platform to buy and sell goods and services online as well as job postings, trade programs, and community event. 

## Motivation 

As a first-generation Haitian American, I am always looking for ways to give back to the Haitian community. One of the best ways to do so is to provide access to opportunities that can increase people's economic mobility. I see a platform like A Mache as the perfect way to do so. A Mache will create a virtual space for all Haitian people to connect with one another to buy and sell goods, advertise services, or promote jobs opportunities and events.

## Installation
To test it out, clone down this repo and run:
- `cd a-mache-client`

Clone the back-end repo and run
