            <li>Do not provide payment to anyone you have not met in person.</li>
            <li>Beware offers involving shipping - deal with locals you can meet in person.</li>
            <li>Never wire funds (e.g. Western Union) - anyone who asks you to is a scammer.</li>
            <li>Don't accept cashier/certified checks or money orders - banks cash fakes, then hold you responsible.</li>
            <li>Transactions are between users only, no third party provides a "guarantee".</li>
            <li>Never give out financial info (bank account, social security, paypal account, etc).</li>
            <li>Do not rent or purchase sight-unseen—that amazing "deal" may not exist.</li>
            <li>Refuse background/credit checks until you have met landlord/employer in person.</li>
            <li>"Craigslist Voicemails" - Any message asking you to access or check "craigslist voicemails" or "craigslist voice messages" is fraudulent - no such service exists.</li>
